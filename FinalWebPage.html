    My name is Rachel Mathew, I am 16 years old and I love to travel. In class we were given the task of creating
    a website about something that you are passionate about. I chose photography, more specifically traveling photography.
    This website has pictures that I have taken in the different places that I have visited. Hope you enjoy!

<h4>
  One place that I have traveled to was Madrid, Spain. When I was there I visited Sangrada Familia,
  this a church designed by the artist Gaudi. Below is an image of said church.

<h4>
  During my Spain trip I also visited Barcelona. While there I visited two more of Gaudi's designs, both of which were houses. Their names were Casa Batllo--which he designed to resemble the ocean--and Casa Mila--which resembles a sandcastle. There pictures are shown below.

  In Barcelona, I also visited the FC Barcelona Stadium. I got to see the field that the team plays on, I also got to see their trophies and jerseys.
